# ESP32 GPT

You need to enable USB hub support for my exact build in `sdkconfig`.

This project is written in C++, some of it generated by AI, most of it
handwritten.

I tested it with a Xiao ESP32-S3. Just connect it to a powered USB hub and then
to a serial device with a terminal, and it should work fine.

Your setup needs **USB-OTG support**.
